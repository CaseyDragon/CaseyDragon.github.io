        <h1>Well Hello! I'm Casey!</h1>

        <p>I am a full stack software engineer, but this is definitely not where I thought I would be. After many years as a homeschool parent, 
            I became insterested in web development when my children started using and making mods for the games they were playing online.
            I really enjoyed this new hobby, but the mom in me took over and began realizing the full-potential of gamified learning, especially for those with learning disabilities.
            I became obsessed and am excited to make learning easier and much more fun for children and adults too!
