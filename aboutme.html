        <h1>Hello! I'm Casey!</h1>

        <p>I am a full stack software engineer, but this is definitely not where I thought I would end up. Here's my story!</p>
        <p>Following in the footsteps of my aunts and grandmother, I started working in healthcare right after highschool. I received several certifications and began working with cognitively disabled adults.
            I began nursing school to further this career, but unfortunamtely was unable to finish. As I entered motherhood, I began working with children that had troubled pasts or developmental/learning disablities. I found great joy in 
    helping these children overcome their obstacles and meet their full potential before entering kindergarten. As my own children grew, we decided to homeschool and eventually discovered that they also had a combination of neurodivergence and learning disablities.
    As the years went by, we learned together how to overcome these difficulties while allowing their strengths and interests to flourish, mostly through games and kinestetic learning.

</p>
<p>But where does software engineering come in to play you may ask? When my son reached middle school, we began experimenting with mods in several video games. For him this was a simple way 
    to play his games how he wanted, but I was hooked. I took a few classes and ultimately ended up in a bootcamp to learn more. I love the possibility of taking my lifelong interest in helping the neurodivergent and learning diasabled 
    reach their goals to a new level. I believe that software designed to gamify learning and help with cognitive function is an amazing advancement of our culture. I look forward to being a part of this development.
